Determine the time of all four algorithm of each best, worst and average case on the following input.

For example:

Input size 10:   ( 2 marks)

Best case of Insertion sort:
Best case of bubble sort:
Best case of merge sort:
Best case of quick sort:

Worst case of insertion sort:
Worst case of bubble sort:
Worst case of merge sort:
Worst case of quick sort:

Average case of insertion sort:
Average case of bubble sort:
Average case of merge sort:
Average case of quick sort:


You will do the same for the remaining inputs: 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 ( 2 * 5 = 10)

To get the above values, you need to run your code multiple times by changing the size, order and sort mechanism. 

You can open any doc or spreadsheet file and record those values there. The best is to create those tables in Excel

Now, you have values ranging from 10 to 100000 (before 10000, if you get infinity value). Make a graph using these valuues.

A graph showing the best case comparison of all the four sorts  (2 marks)
A graph showing the worst case comparison of all the four sorts (2 marks)
A graph showing the average (random) case comparison of all the four sorts (2 marks)

Also give 2 - 3 lines description of each graph ( we have total 3 graphs each description has 2 marks)

Conclusions of ther analysis (1 marks)
